             <h3>MOBILE DEMANDS</h3>
             <div class="skill1"><h4> Demanding of Mobiles:</h4>
             <ul class="ullist">
               <li><b>1.</b>Samsung <p>Much of Samsung’s interest generator was likely the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, which may have led it to become one of the top 10 smartphone brands in India in Q1 2023. The smartphone, like every year, became among the very first to launch with Qualcomm’s new flagship chip, and according to Samsung itself, the Galaxy S23 series has already sold 1.4x more than 2022’s Galaxy S22. All of this has led to Samsung being the most searched smartphone brand in Q1 2023, with a 17 percent share.</p> </li>
               <li><b>2.</b>Xiomi<p>At the second spot, just as in the smartphone shipment market shares, is Xiaomi, capturing 15.9 percent of all user searches on 91mobiles. The China brand, which for long ruled the Indian smartphone market as the number one selling brand, notably launched its flagship Xiaomi 13 Pro in India during this period.Like Samsung, the Xiaomi 13 Pro is one of the first phones with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in India, and alongside this, it offers a host of premium features such as a 2K+ display, three 50MP rear cameras, and an association with legendary German camera-maker, Leica. It is this launch, coupled with the rollout commencement of Xiaomi’s custom interface, MIUI 14, that kept the brand at the top of the search and user interest queries through Q1 2023.</p></li>
               <li><b>3.</b> Realme<P>At the third spot in terms of user interest is Realme, which has had a comparatively quieter start to the year in India. However, the company did unveil the Realme GT 3 at the Mobile World Congress this year, which has made its way to India already. The flagship-grade smartphone runs on a generation-old flagship Qualcomm chip, but nevertheless makes for an interesting package in terms of overall specs and pricing.</P></li>
               <li><b>4.</b>Oneplus<p>The presence of OnePlus near the top of the list would have been a bigger surprise had it happened in shipment figures but is not so much in terms of user interest. In the first three months of the year, OnePlus took to the stage to launch its flagship for the year — the OnePlus 11 5G. The latter has since been critically acclaimed and makes for one of the most well-balanced flagship smartphones of the year so far.</p></li>
               <li><b>5.</b>Iphone<p>iPhone is a line of smartphones produced by Apple Inc. that use Apple's own iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold. As of 2022, the iPhone accounts for 15.6% of global smartphone market share.</p> </li>

             <h3>HISTORICAL PLACES VISITING DEMANDS </h3>
             <div class="skill1"><h4> Demanding of some historical places in the world</h4>
             <ul class="ullist">
               <li><b>1.</b>Machu Picchu:<p>Located in southern Peru, this ruined city lies on top of a mountain that’s only accessible by train or hiking the Inca Trail. Rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911, it was an important cultural center for the Inca civilization but was abandoned when the Spanish invaded the region. (It is famously referred to as the “Lost City of the Incas,” though that is actually Vilcabamba). The location was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and it was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.              </p></li>
               <li><b>2.</b>Tikal:<p>The ruined temples of the Mayan city of Tikal, in the jungles of Guatemala
                Tikal National Park is home to the largest and best-preserved ruins of the ancient Mayan civilization, and the city-state centered here was a dominant force in the Mayan world during the Classic Period (200-900 CE). Located in Guatemala, be sure to spend the night in the park, as you’ll really get to see it without the crowds.</p></li>
               <li><b>3.</b>The Pyramids at Giza:<p>The towering pyramids in the desert of Egypt, with the mysterious Sphinx in the foreground
                The Pyramids are truly a marvel of human engineering. They’re over 3,000 years old, and we still don’t have a good idea as to how they were built or how the Egyptians made them so precise. The three pyramids align with the stars and the solstices, and contain tons of chambers that still haven’t been (and cannot be) opened. I mean, how did they create those little chambers where people can’t even crawl through?</p></li>
               <li><b>4.</b>Angkor Wat:<p>This ancient city in Cambodia was the center of the Khmer Empire that once ruled most of Southeast Asia. This empire fell into decline, but not before building amazing temples and buildings that were later reclaimed by the jungle for hundreds of years.</p> </li>
               <li><b>5.</b>The Colosseum and Forum:<p>The Colosseum and the Forum are right next to each other in Rome. The Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in the entire Roman Empire (it could hold 50,000-80,000 people), while the Roman Forum was the center of Roman public life and the place from which Rome administered its empire. Remnants of a civilization that once controlled the known world, these sites are breathtaking not only for their beauty but also for their history and age, dating back around 2,000 years.</p></li>
